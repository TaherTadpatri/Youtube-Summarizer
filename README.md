# Introduction

This project aims to facilitate learning from YouTube videos by providing automatic assessment generation based on the video content.

When a user shares a YouTube link:
- The platform extracts chapters from the video and generates summaries for each chapter using the transcript.
- Users can query the platform if they encounter difficulties understanding certain concepts.
- Assessments are generated based on the content covered in each chapter, aiding in efficient learning.
